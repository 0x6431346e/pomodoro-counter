React boilerplate for Aragon applications.

This boilerplate also includes a fully working example app, complete with a background worker and a front-end in React (with Aragon UI).

## Usage

```sh
aragon init foo.aragonpm.test react
```

## Running your app

### Using HTTP

Running your app using HTTP will allow for a faster development process of your app's front-end, as it can be hot-reloaded without the need to execute `aragon run` every time a change is made.

- First start your app's development server running `npm run start:app`, and keep that process running. By default it will rebuild the app and reload the server when changes to the source are made.

- After that, you can run `npm run start:aragon:http` which will compile your app's contracts, publish the app locally and create a DAO. You will need to stop it and run it again after making changes to your smart contracts.

Changes to the app's background script (`app/script.js`) cannot be hot-reloaded, after making changes to the script, you will need to either restart the development server (`npm run start:app`) or rebuild the script `npm run build:script`.

### Using IPFS

Running your app using IPFS will mimic the production environment that will be used for running your app. `npm run start:aragon:ipfs` will run your app using IPFS. Whenever a change is made to any file in your front-end, a new version of the app needs to be published, so the command needs to be restarted.

## What's in the box?

### npm Scripts

- **start** or **start:aragon:ipfs**: Runs your app inside a DAO served from IPFS
- **start:aragon:http**: Runs your app inside a DAO served with HTTP (hot reloading)
- **start:app**: Starts a development server for your app
- **compile**: Compile the smart contracts
- **build**: Builds the front-end and background script
- **build:app**: Builds the front-end
- **build:script**: Builds the background script
- **test**: Runs tests for the contracts
- **publish**: Builds the apps and the contracts and publishes them to IPFS and APM

### Libraries

- [**@aragon/os**](https://github.com/aragon/aragonos): Aragon interfaces
- [**@aragon/client**](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/tree/master/packages/aragon-client): Wrapper for Aragon application RPC
- [**@aragon/ui**](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-ui): Aragon UI components (in React)

#### Publish

This app has 3 environments defined in `arapp.json`:

| Environment | Network |
|---|---|
| default | localhost |
| staging | rinkeby |
| production | mainnet |

Prerequisites:
- ENS Registry address

Command:

```
aragon apm publish minor --environment staging --files build
```

This will _build_ the app, _compile_ the contracts and publish the app to the **staging** environment.
This environment defined in `arapp.json` points to:
- an ENS registry (`0x314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b`)
- an APM registry (`open.aragonpm.eth`)
- an APM repository (`pomodoro-counter`)
- an Ethereum network (`rinkeby`)

the `rinkeby` network is further defined in `truffle.js`, and has:
- an Ethereum API address (`https://rinkeby.infura.io`)
- an Ethereum Account (`0xb4124cEB3451635DAcedd11767f004d8a28c6eE7`)
    (which is the first account generated from the `DEFAULT_MNEMONIC` variable)

Sample output:
```
% aragon apm publish minor --environment staging --files build
 ‚úî Check IPFS
 ‚úî Applying version bump (minor)
 ‚úî Deploy contract
 ‚úî Determine contract address for version
 ‚úî Building frontend
 ‚úî Prepare files for publishing
 ‚úî Generate application artifact
 ‚úî Publish pomodoro-counter.open.aragonpm.eth
 ‚úî Fetch published repo

 ‚úî Successfully published pomodoro-counter.open.aragonpm.eth v0.1.0: 
 ‚Ñπ Contract address: 0x12137D5da5529E26235f421Be5D79807CB6C5cae

```

To deploy from a different account, you can:
- define a `~/.aragon/mnemonic.json` file
    ```
    {
        "mnemonic": "explain tackle mirror kit ..."
    }
    ```
    or
- define a `~/.aragon/rinkeby_key.json` file
    ```
    {
        "rpc": "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
        "keys": [
            "a8a54b2d8197bc0b19bb8a084031be71835580a01e70a45a13babd16c9bc1563"
        ]
    }
    ```


You might encounter the following error:
1. `No "from" address specified in neither the given options, nor the default options.`
    That is because the network you are trying to deploy does not have an Ethereum account provider
